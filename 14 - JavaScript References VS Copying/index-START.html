    // start with strings, numbers and booleans
    let age = 100
    let age2 = age;
    console.log(age, age2) // 100, 100
    age = 200
    console.log(age, age2) // 200, 100

    let name = 'John'
    let name2 = name
    console.log(name, name2) // 'John', 'John'
    name = 'Phil'
    console.log(name, name2) // 'Phil', 'John'

    // Let's say we have an array
    const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];
    // and we want to make a copy of it.
    const team = players;
    console.log(players, team)
    // You might think we can just do something like this:
    function changeThirdMember(players) {
      players[3] = 'Lux'
    }
    // changeThirdMember(team)
    // console.log(team)

    // however what happens when we update that array?
    // now here is the problem!
    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!
    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!
    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!
    // one way
    const team2 = players.slice()       // way #1
    team2[3] = 'Allison'
    console.log(players)
    console.log(team2)
    const team3 = [].concat(players)    // way #2
    const team4 = [...players]          // way #3 (ES6)
    const team5 = Array.from(players)   // way #4 (ES6)

    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed
    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object
    // with Objects
    const person = {
      name: 'Clay Shaw',
      age: 80,
      social: {
        twitter: '@itsClay'
      }
    }
    // and think we make a copy:
    const captain = person;
    captain.number = 99
    // console.log(captain) // this will reference the old one

    // how do we take a copy instead?
    const captain2 = Object.assign({}, person, {number: 99, age: 13})
    console.log(captain2) // this will make a copy and leave person alone

    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread
    // const cap3 = {...person}



    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
    // poor mans deep clone
    const dev = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(person)) // essentially shake off all the references
    console.log(dev)
